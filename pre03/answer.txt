Question 1: What is the output of the following program? Be precise about where there are spaces and where there are newlines.
Hint: Start by describing in words what ping and baffle do when they are invoked.

The output of this program is: 

No, I wug.
You wugga Wug. 
I wug.
ping baffle

It begins from main, printing "No,I "
Then baffle tells it to print "wug" and ping tells it to add a "." as the last line before a new one.

Next it begins a new line to invoke "zoop" which starts baffle again making printing "You wugga" and adding another "wug" and "." because of the baffle. 

Last it prints "I " on a new line, followed by baffle with another "wug" and "."

Question 2: Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program the first time ping is invoked.

Stack Diagram for first Ping

ping "."

* p.s: Please help clarify Q2, not sure if I completed this correctly.

What happens if you invoke baffle(); at the end of the ping method? (We will see why in the next chapter.)

If you invoke baffle at the end of the ping method it will begin with "." and then add "wug" and then ping "."

It would read: 

. wug.

It would also cause a stack overflow error where ping and baffle repeat in a loop.
